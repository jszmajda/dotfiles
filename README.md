# Jess's Dotfiles

## Installation

* Install Vim-plug https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
* Install bash-it https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it
* Copy `.bash_secure.template` to `.bash_secure`, fill in the stuff in
  brackets.
* From your home:
    * `ln -sf /(fully qualified path to this repo)/.* ~/`
    * `rm .git .bash_it`
    * this isn't meant to be perfect, Jess only needs to use this like once or twice a year ;)
* Profit!
